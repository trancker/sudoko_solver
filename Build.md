### Build Instructions

Simply clone the repository and run the following command in the site folder:
```
python app.py
```
Keras, TensorFlow along with SciPy need to be installed for the site to work along with Flask. If the standalone sudoku solver module is desired then simply import the sudoku model in the sudoku folder. Usage of this can be seen in the site folder as well.

The repository also contains a lot of the old standard numpy implementation along with testing code in the old folder. This can be safely neglected.
